Balanced tree=if left and right childs are equal then it is balanced
Unbalanced if no of left and right childs are not equal then its unbalanced and its a O(N) running time
keeps the keys in sorted order
binary search in sorted array

InOrder Traversal--left node + root node +right node recursively---sorted order for integers or alphabetically
Pre-order---root + left tree + right tree recursively
Post -order---left tree + right tree + root recursively
